// In this kata, you will create an object that returns the positions and the values of the "peaks" (or local maxima) of a numeric array.  For example, the array arr = [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 1 , 0 ] has a peak in position 3 with a value of 5 (arr[3] = 5) The output will be returned as an object with two properties: pos and peaks. Both of these properties should be arrays. If there is no peak in the given array, then the output should be {pos: [], peaks: []}.

// NOTE: plateaus. In the case of 1 2 2 1, return the peak/pos of the first 2. Makes it significantly more complicated.

// Best practices version: similar to my first attempt, using the < through an iteration of the array. His cleverness though was after placement, setting to a cardinal value of position to prevent adding multiple times on a decline (e.g. 4, 3, 2, 1) 
function bpPickPeaks(arr) {
  var result = {pos: [], peaks: []};
  if(arr.length > 2) {
    var pos = -1;

      if(arr[i] > arr[i-1]) {

      } else if(arr[i] < arr[i-1] && pos != -1) {

/*   var out = {
      pos: [],
      peaks: []
   };*/
   // First definition of a peak: something greater than either of the two neighboring elements
   // However, this doesn't pass the plateau test. Can we modify the above def to handle plateaus?
   // What if we turn ALL the values in the array into position/value objects
   // And if we see multiple value objects in a row, we remove them from our array
   // Then we can apply our simple test
