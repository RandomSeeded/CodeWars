// Assignment: determine the combination of items that fits within the container and max's the value of the collection
// Approximate this by adding the item to the collection if it has the highest value-to-size ratio

// We need to think about our structures better

// Best practices version:
function bpKnapsack(capacity, items) {
   var sortedItems = items.map(function(item, i) { return item.concat([i]) } )
      .sort(function(a, b) { return a[0]/a[1] > b[0]/b[1]; });
   // Sorted items by ratio
   // Also note he just used concat to give the items a third "property". I had been considering making weird objects because it seemed maybe better than having the random three arrays (which I knew was a problem), but this is way cleaner/better

   // This is an interesting way of creating an array with all items 0 of the equiv length. I like it
   var quantities = items.map(function() { return 0; });

   // And better logic than for the while loop, but nothing revolutionary here
   // The reason he can just do a single foreach loop is because his array is sorted by ratio
   // We WANTED to sort by ratio, but couldn't, because sorting on ratio would have knocked it out of alignment with the other arrays. This is the nice thing about having the single array of [3 element arrays]
   sortedItems.forEach(function(item) {
      var nb = capacity / item[0] | 0;
      capacity -= nb*item[0];
      quantities[item[2]] = nb;
   });
   return quantities;
}

// capacity: positive number
// items: [[]], in format: [[size1, value1][size2, value2]]
// return array of integers that specifies how many of each item to take
function knapsack(capacity, items) {
   // lets use a map to generate the value/size ratio and also just a list of sizes
   var ratios = items.map(function(value) {
      return value[1] / value[0];
   });
   var sizes = items.map(function(value) {
      return value[0];
   });

   // LOGIC:
   // As long as we are CAPABLE OF ADDING MORE ITEMS
   // Add the item with the biggest ratio that will fit
   // Do it again

   // initialize added items array: set all elements to 0
   var addedItems = new Array(items.length);
   for (var i = 0; i < addedItems.length; i++) { addedItems[i] = 0; }

   // While it is still possible to add any items into our knapsack
   while (sizes.reduce(function(smallest, value) { return Math.min(smallest, value); }, Infinity) <= capacity ) {
      // Find the one with the largest ratio that will fit (this could probably be handled better)
      var bestIdx = 0;
      var bestRatio = items.reduce(function(bestRatio, value, i, arr) {
         if (ratios[i] > bestRatio && sizes[i] <= capacity) { 
            bestRatio = ratios[i];
            bestIdx = i;
         }
         return bestRatio;
      }, 0);
      // Add it to our capacity
      addedItems[bestIdx]++;
      capacity -= sizes[bestIdx];
   }
   return addedItems;
}
