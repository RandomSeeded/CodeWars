// best practices version:
// So big change vs my thought:
// I thought I had to do a GLOBAL variable, which was super hackish.
// But I do NOT
// Because the closure (inner fn) has access to the outer fn's vars
// So all we do is modify the function we RETURN [inner fn] such that it has an if statement inside of it
// Which we declared inside the outer function. Clever

// takes a function as an argument, and returns a new version of that function that can only be called once...not sure where to go from here
